# DnD-5e-2024-Spells
An ObsidianMD folder of OGL DnD 5e 2024 Spells along with Excel list of spells with md import, overwrite, and move macros. A CSV of spells and description is present. Obsidian organization is exclusively tags so the user may implement their own method. 

class spell list indexes also present

if you are interested in the xlsm please know that it is macro enabled. Please review the macros before running (can replace the cluncy folder picker with a direct path). It makes it easy to add organization methods (I used it to add tags as demonstrated in the document)
